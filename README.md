## Introduction
The problem: In many Indian cities, maintaining street lights is inefficient due to a lack of centralized monitoring. Faults go unnoticed until citizens complain, causing delays and safety issues. Linemen spend too much time manually searching for and fixing issues.

The solution needed: An innovative system for real-time fault detection, accurate identification of fault types, and precise location tracking of faulty street lights. This system aims to empower linemen, reduce their workload, and enable proactive fault management by local authorities. Overall, it's about developing an Automated Defect Detection and Prevention Assistance with Effective Governance for Cities in India.
